# developer-test

### Hello world!

This project will be your exam. You will need to implement an API that serves items of type Song. Each Song can have multiple Artists which are referenced via another service. For the purposes of this test dummy data will do.


Implement the 3 endpoints in SongController to:
1. Retrieve a song's title given an artist's name
2. Get a list of all unique artist names in the Song database
3. Get a tally of song counts per genre in the Song database

You may create extra classes or interfaces, but please keep the existing code. We will run the AppTest "unit" test to check if the code works. This is meant to check your logic skills and familiarity with Java and Spring. And of course, your Google-fu.

Good luck!
